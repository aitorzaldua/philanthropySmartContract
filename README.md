# NFT Lottery Marketplace | Platzi ETH Developer Program final challenge

Developed using solidity for smart contracts and hardhat for testing/deployment.

The contract allows for users to publish NFT lotteries and buy tickets. Winners are chosen automatically utilizing an integration of Chainlink VRF and Keeper services.

As part of the project, we also created a frontend where users can interact with the contract in a more friendly way and lotteries can have exposure. Link to the frontend repository: 

The contract connected with the frontend is deployed in the GÃ¶rli testnet: https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xEDcF7b2B1aF812FF9Af468FC4A3324647423CE14
